## Upcoming Schedule

| Date | Person | Information |
| ---  | ---  | --- |
| October 26th | Shaojun Zhu | **Recent applications of deep learning in robotics<br>(Perhaps focusing on grasping)**  <br> Some relevant papers: [[1]](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3592.pdf)[[2]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3128)[[3]](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~allen/PAPERS/iros15_grasp_varley.pdf)[[4]](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06825v1.pdf)[[5]](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.00702v3.pdf).  <br>[1-4] are on detecting grasping locations for robots using deep learning.  The last one for Pieter Abbeel's group in Berkeley is more interesting in the sense that it tries to learn control policies directly from visual input.  His group is one of the first advocates for deep learning in robotics and has a series of related work.  I have not read about it in details, so I may not cover it this time. |
| November 2nd | Dong Yang | |
| November 9th | Yan Zhu | **RNN and memory network (abstract to be updated)** |
| November 16th | Brian McMahan | |
| November 23rd | Babak Saleh | |
| November 30th | Amr Bakry | |

## Rules

1. Members of the reading group will take turns presenting a paper or their own work to the group
2. There are no 'bystander' attendees.  
3. Presenting a paper does not have to be an immense endeavor.  Reading a paper and telling the group what it is about is necessary and sufficient.

### FAQ
1. How is the presenters' order generated?
    - The presenters' order is generated from the member list in a FIFO manner. 
2. Who is responsible if I can not present at the schedule time?
    - Yourself.  
3. What should I do if I can not present at the scheduled time?
    - First, let the organizer know your situation, as early as possible.  Second, contact other presenters on the list and see if they are willing to swap with you.
4. What happens if a new event takes place and we have to change the schedule?
    - To minimize disturbance, the conflicted spot will be moved to the rear of the list after confirmed with the original presenter, while all other schedules remain unchanged.
